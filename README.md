https://bitwisecmd.com is a web-based bitwise calculation tool. Its main goal is to help people understand how bitwise operaiton works by presenting numbers and operation results in binary format.

I initially created a tool in 2012 to help me better understand how Flags enums work in C#. I've decided to share it with everyone by converting it into the web application in 2015. And of course I couldn't resist the temptation to write my own JavaScript framework similar to Angular JS. I released the first version after 4 days of working from home while being on a sick live and having a mild feaver. It had templating engine and DI container. Since then I rewrote it in React because suprise-suprise supporting framework that you wrote yourself is not as easy as one might think. Espcially if you return to it after long pause. Still, I regret nothig. You can see [here](https://github.com/BorysLevytskyi/BitwiseCmd/blob/a01ca1c67040312e7c7774705b0fe48296da10ac/src/index.html#L134-L145) and [here](https://github.com/BorysLevytskyi/BitwiseCmd/blob/a01ca1c67040312e7c7774705b0fe48296da10ac/src/js/app.js) how application looked like back then (spoiler: very similar to AngularJS).

After some time I got into learning about networking in AWS. I needed to understand how IP subnet masks and CIDR notations work. Again, it was about bitwise operations. So I've extended BitwiseCmd with additional commands such as `subnet`, `vpc`, and support of IP address inputs.
